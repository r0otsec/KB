- Physical device acting on some part of a physical process.
- Can be things like motors, valves, switches etc...
- In [[ICS (Industrial Control System)|ICS]], they receive commands - typically from controllers ([[PLC (Programmable Logic Controller)|PLC]], [[DCS (Distributed Control System)|DCS]] or [[RTU (Remote Telemetry Unit)|DCS]]) to adjust physical processes such as:
	- opening a valve
	- turning robot arm
# Common Types

Common types include:

- Electric motors - used in pumps, fans, conveyor belts, robotic systems.
- Valves - control flow of liquids or gases.
- Solenoids - used in simple linear actuation (locking/unlocking).
- Hydraulic/pneumatic actuators - for heavy machinery (industrial presses).
- Relays/switches - for circuit control or mechanical toggling.
